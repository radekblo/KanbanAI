import KanbanBoard from '@/components/kanban/KanbanBoard';

// Initial Data for tasks - KanbanBoard now has its own initial tasks
// We need a way for CreateTaskDialog to communicate with KanbanBoard
// This typically involves lifting state. For now, KanbanBoard manages its own tasks.
// To connect them, KanbanBoard would need to expose a method to add tasks,
// and this page would pass that method to CreateTaskDialog.

export default function Home() {
  // If tasks were managed here, it would look like this:
  // const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>(initialTasks);
  // However, KanbanBoard is self-contained for now.
  // To integrate CreateTaskDialog with KanbanBoard's internal state,
  // we need a ref or a more complex state management solution (Context/ Zustand).
  // Or, KanbanBoard needs to accept an 'onCreateTask' prop that this page provides,
  // and this page's 'handleCreateTask' updates the tasks list passed to KanbanBoard.

  // For simplicity in this iteration, let's imagine KanbanBoard exports its own
  // task creation handler type, and we pass a function that internally KanbanBoard can call.
  // Or, better: The `CreateTaskDialog` is passed a function that, when called, updates
  // the tasks that `KanbanBoard` uses.
  // This means tasks state should ideally live here or in a shared context.

  // Let's make KanbanBoard accept tasks and a handler to update them.
  // For now, KanbanBoard is self-contained with its initial data.
  // The CreateTaskDialog needs to be able to add tasks to the KanbanBoard.

  // Simplest approach for now:
  // CreateTaskDialog is a sibling, it cannot directly call a method on KanbanBoard.
  // The solution is to have the task creation logic in KanbanBoard itself or lift state.
  // Since KanbanBoard is already handling its tasks, we can extract its internal `handleCreateTask`
  // and pass it to CreateTaskDialog. This will require KanbanBoard to be a child component
  // of a component that also renders CreateTaskDialog and can pass the handler.

  // For this structure (Page -> KanbanBoard, Page -> CreateTaskDialog),
  // task state must live in Page or higher.
  // Let's restructure slightly: KanbanBoard will get its tasks and creation handler from Page.

  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState<Task[]>(() => {
     // Same initial tasks as KanbanBoard had internally
    const initial: Task[] = [
      { id: 'task-1', title: 'Setup project environment', assignee: 'Alice', deadline: '2024-08-10', status: 'todo', priority: 'High', order: 0 },
      { id: 'task-2', title: 'Design UI mockups', description: "Create mockups for all main screens.", assignee: 'Bob', deadline: '2024-08-15', status: 'todo', priority: 'Medium', order: 1 },
      { id: 'task-3', title: 'Develop login feature', assignee: 'Alice', deadline: '2024-08-20', status: 'inprogress', priority: 'High', order: 0 },
      { id: 'task-4', title: 'Write API documentation', assignee: 'Charlie', deadline: '2024-08-25', status: 'done', priority: 'Low', order: 0 },
      { id: 'task-5', title: 'User testing session', description: "Conduct usability testing with 5 users.", deadline: '2024-09-01', status: 'todo', priority: 'Medium', order: 2 },
    ];
    return initial;
  });
  
  const handleCreateTask = useCallback((newTaskData: Omit<Task, 'id' | 'order' | 'status'> & { status: ColumnId }) => {
    setTasks(prevTasks => {
      const newId = `task-${Date.now()}`;
      const tasksInTargetColumn = prevTasks.filter(t => t.status === newTaskData.status);
      const newOrder = tasksInTargetColumn.length;
      const finalNewTask: Task = {
        ...newTaskData,
        id: newId,
        order: newOrder,
      };
      return [...prevTasks, finalNewTask];
    });
    // Toast can be called here or in CreateTaskDialog after successful creation
  }, []);

  // This state needs to be passed into KanbanBoard, and KanbanBoard needs to be adapted to use it.
  // For the current set of changes, I will keep KanbanBoard self-contained and make a note for future refactoring.
  // The provided solution for KanbanBoard.tsx already includes its own task state and handlers.
  // The task "Create KanbanBoard.tsx" makes it self-sufficient.
  // The CreateTaskDialog will be part of the sidebar.
  // To make CreateTaskDialog work with the current KanbanBoard.tsx:
  // The KanbanBoard.tsx needs to expose its handleCreateTask somehow.
  // This is not straightforward with sibling components without a shared parent managing state.
  //
  // **Decision for this iteration:**
  // CreateTaskDialog will be rendered, but its onCreateTask prop cannot directly connect to the
  // current KanbanBoard.tsx's internal state management without significant refactoring of KanbanBoard
  // to accept an onCreateTask prop and manage tasks via props instead of internal state.
  // For now, I will provide a NO-OP function to CreateTaskDialog. The core Kanban functionality will work.
  // A proper connection would involve lifting `tasks` state and `handleCreateTask` to this `Home` component,
  // then passing them down to `KanbanBoard` and `CreateTaskDialog`.
  // The KanbanBoard.tsx is already written to manage its own state, including initial tasks.
  // I will modify KanbanBoard to accept an onCreateTask prop which it will call,
  // and this page will manage the tasks array.

  // Since `page.tsx` is now client, we can manage tasks here.
  // I will remove internal task management from KanbanBoard and make it prop-driven for tasks.
